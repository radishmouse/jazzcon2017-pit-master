# PitMaster

This is an example React app built for JazzCon 2017.

It inaccurately simulates cooking food while showing
the current temperature, temperature history, and oven temperature.

## Installation

After cloning, `cd` into directory and then either `npm install` or `yarn`.

## Running

Primary interface is React Storybook, which you run via: `npm storybook` or `yarn storybook`.

Then, if your browser is not opened for you, go to [localhost:9009](http://localhost:9009)
to view the storybook.

Alternatively, run `npm start` or `yarn start`, which should open your browser to
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
